# Indigena

Indigena is an app to help local gardeners and farmers plant native plant species. It has informational guidance on what species to plant, how to plant them, and the effect that they will have on local pest and animal populations. 

Why is this a problem?

Farmers, local gardeners, and your common person have no idea that America’s natural landscape was formerly vast grasslands, not the woody forests that we think they are today. The truth of the matter is that Europeans when colonizing America, brought over all their familiar European forests back with them in the new land. They planted these trees in such excess that we now have little to no remnants of what the native landscape was. 

While we humans are easily adaptable to different landscapes, the original native animal and plant species have not yet adapted. The changes to the landscape have caused an ecological imbalance resulting in various overgrowths, invasive species, and competition. There is now an overwhelming amount of pest species that are attacking farmer’s crops with none of the natural ecological systems in place to keep the pests at bay. 

Planting native can bring back our native ecosystem and regulate animals, plants, pests, and people.
