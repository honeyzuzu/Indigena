<h1>Indigena: Reconnecting with Native Landscapes</h1>
<p>Indigena is a mobile application designed to assist local gardeners and farmers in planting native plant species. It provides comprehensive guidance on selecting suitable species, planting techniques, and the impact of these plants on local pest and animal populations.</p>

<h2>The Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Many farmers, local gardeners, and members of the general public are unaware that America's natural landscape was once dominated by vast grasslands, not the wooded forests commonly seen today. Historically, European settlers imported familiar European forest species to America, inadvertently altering the native landscape significantly. As a result, little remains of the original ecosystem.</p>

<p>While humans can adapt to various landscapes, the original native animal and plant species have not had sufficient time to adjust. This disruption has led to ecological imbalances, including overgrowth, invasive species, and heightened competition. Consequently, there is now a proliferation of pest species attacking crops, with natural ecological systems failing to keep these pests in check.</p>

<h2>Solution: Embracing Native Planting</h2>
<p>Indigena advocates for the revival of native ecosystems through the planting of indigenous plant species. By reintroducing these native plants, we can restore ecological balance, regulate animal populations, and mitigate pest infestations. Through Indigena, users can make informed decisions that contribute to the restoration of natural habitats.</p>
